# Sketchbook-Animator


## Description
This program takes in a video then re-renders the video in with a Sketch Animation effect, 
Built using Open CV 

## Try it out
1. First install dependancies, this includes Numpy and OpenCV, to do this run 
> **pip install numpy** 
> **pip install opencv-python**  
3. Put the video you want to use inside a new directory called **"video"** (make sure to name correctly) 
4. Run **main.py** in the **"pyScripts directory**" 
5. Wait for the program to render, when completed a new video in the root directory called **"finalVideo.avi** should appear 

## Notes 
* This program runs best with videos that are under 2 minutes at 1080p  
* Videos that are high quality and longer in length will take significantly longer to render
